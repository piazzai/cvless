# About


This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](/cv) to see the full CV, and [here](/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](/posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](/404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).


Below is a list of blog posts included for illustrative purposes. Make sure to delete or modify them before deploying your website.
